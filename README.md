## About

This is the final project of Deep Learning (CS2470, Fall 2017) at Brown University replicating the paper proposed by [Bahdanau *et al*. (2014)][1]. We will implement two models, which are RNNencdec and RNNsearch. We try to reproduce the results of this paper but will make some changes to the datasets and evaluation methods.

## Data

Training Data: bitexts.selected Development Data: dev.ntst1213 Test Data: dev.ntst14

see files [here](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/~schwenk/cslm_joint_paper/README)

## Preprocess

Pick 30,000 most frequent words in each language as vocabularies to train models and others are marked as 'UNK'.
